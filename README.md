# üìà Influencer Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive dashboard built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), designed to **track and visualize the Return on Investment (ROI) of influencer marketing campaigns** across various social media platforms and product brands.

## üìñ About

**Influencer Dashboard** is an open-source analytics platform designed for brands and agencies to measure the effectiveness of influencer marketing campaigns. Built with Streamlit and Python, the dashboard enables teams to track campaign performance, calculate ROI, and optimize marketing spend across multiple social media channels.

Whether you‚Äôre a marketer analyzing campaign impact, a data scientist building custom reports, or a developer looking to customize the workflow, this tool provides:
- **Automated campaign summaries** (revenue, payouts, ROAS)
- **Influencer analytics** (top performers, engagement metrics, category/platform breakdown)
- **Real-time data filtering and visualization**
- **Transparent payout tracking** across compensation models
- **Raw data previews and export options** for further analysis
- **Synthetic sample datasets** for demo and prototyping

The project is ideal for learning, prototyping, or operational use in environments where influencer campaign tracking, reporting, and optimization are critical.

## üåü Project Overview

**Context:**  
Companies like HealthKart run extensive influencer campaigns on platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok to promote products from multiple brands. Influencers are compensated based on models such as per post or per order generated. Measuring the effectiveness and profitability of these campaigns is crucial for optimizing marketing spend.

**Objective:**  
Provide an open-source tool/dashboard for comprehensive tracking and visualization of influencer campaign performance, including key metrics like ROI and Incremental ROAS.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Campaign Performance Tracking:**
  - Overall summary: Total Revenue, Total Payout, Overall ROAS.
  - Detailed breakdown of Revenue vs. Payout by campaign.
  - Visualization of campaign performance trends over time (weekly revenue).

- **Influencer Insights:**
  - Identify top-performing influencers (by ROAS and Total Revenue).
  - Analyze best-performing influencer categories and platforms.
  - Metrics on post performance (average reach, likes, comments) by platform.
  - Filtering for influencers based on a minimum number of tracking events.

- **Payout Tracking:**
  - Comprehensive display of influencer payout records.
  - Analysis of total payouts distributed by payment basis (per post vs. per order).

- **Interactive Filtering:**
  - Dynamic filters for Date Range, Product(s)/Brand(s), Influencer Category, Platform, Minimum Tracking Events.

- **Raw Data Previews:**
  - View underlying datasets directly in the dashboard.

- **Data Export:**
  - Download filtered tracking data and influencer summaries as CSV.

## üìä Data

The dashboard operates on **simulated datasets** representing real-world influencer campaign data. These datasets are generated by [`data_generator.py`](data_generator.py):

- `influencers.csv`: Influencer profiles (ID, name, category, gender, follower count, platform).
- `posts.csv`: Influencer posts (influencer_id, platform, date, URL, caption, reach, likes, comments).
- `tracking_data.csv`: Campaign tracking events (source, campaign, influencer_id, user_id, product, date, orders, revenue).
- `payouts.csv`: Influencer payment info (influencer_id, basis, rate, orders, total_payout).

*Note: Data is synthetic, for demonstration purposes.*
