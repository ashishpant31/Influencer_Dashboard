# 📈 Influencer Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive dashboard built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), designed to **track and visualize the Return on Investment (ROI) of influencer marketing campaigns** across various social media platforms and product brands.

## 📖 About

**Influencer Dashboard** is an open-source analytics platform designed for brands and agencies to measure the effectiveness of influencer marketing campaigns. Built with Streamlit and Python, the dashboard enables teams to track campaign performance, calculate ROI, and optimize marketing spend across multiple social media channels.

Whether you’re a marketer analyzing campaign impact, a data scientist building custom reports, or a developer looking to customize the workflow, this tool provides:
- **Automated campaign summaries** (revenue, payouts, ROAS)
- **Influencer analytics** (top performers, engagement metrics, category/platform breakdown)
- **Real-time data filtering and visualization**
- **Transparent payout tracking** across compensation models
- **Raw data previews and export options** for further analysis
- **Synthetic sample datasets** for demo and prototyping

The project is ideal for learning, prototyping, or operational use in environments where influencer campaign tracking, reporting, and optimization are critical.

## 🌟 Project Overview

**Context:**  
Companies like HealthKart run extensive influencer campaigns on platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok to promote products from multiple brands. Influencers are compensated based on models such as per post or per order generated. Measuring the effectiveness and profitability of these campaigns is crucial for optimizing marketing spend.

**Objective:**  
Provide an open-source tool/dashboard for comprehensive tracking and visualization of influencer campaign performance, including key metrics like ROI and Incremental ROAS.

## ✨ Features

- **Campaign Performance Tracking:**
  - Overall summary: Total Revenue, Total Payout, Overall ROAS.
  - Detailed breakdown of Revenue vs. Payout by campaign.
  - Visualization of campaign performance trends over time (weekly revenue).

- **Influencer Insights:**
  - Identify top-performing influencers (by ROAS and Total Revenue).
  - Analyze best-performing influencer categories and platforms.
  - Metrics on post performance (average reach, likes, comments) by platform.
  - Filtering for influencers based on a minimum number of tracking events.

- **Payout Tracking:**
  - Comprehensive display of influencer payout records.
  - Analysis of total payouts distributed by payment basis (per post vs. per order).

- **Interactive Filtering:**
  - Dynamic filters for Date Range, Product(s)/Brand(s), Influencer Category, Platform, Minimum Tracking Events.

- **Raw Data Previews:**
  - View underlying datasets directly in the dashboard.

- **Data Export:**
  - Download filtered tracking data and influencer summaries as CSV.

## 📊 Data

The dashboard operates on **simulated datasets** representing real-world influencer campaign data. These datasets are generated by [`data_generator.py`](data_generator.py):

- `influencers.csv`: Influencer profiles (ID, name, category, gender, follower count, platform).
- `posts.csv`: Influencer posts (influencer_id, platform, date, URL, caption, reach, likes, comments).
- `tracking_data.csv`: Campaign tracking events (source, campaign, influencer_id, user_id, product, date, orders, revenue).
- `payouts.csv`: Influencer payment info (influencer_id, basis, rate, orders, total_payout).

*Note: Data is synthetic, for demonstration purposes.*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language
- **Streamlit:** Interactive web dashboard
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy:** Numerical operations
- **Plotly Express:** Interactive charts
- **Faker:** Synthetic data generation (used in `data_generator.py`)

   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   - **Windows:** `.\venv\Scripts\activate`

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If requirements.txt is missing, install: streamlit, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, faker)*

4. **Generate Simulated Data:**
   ```bash
   python data_generator.py
   ```
   This creates the CSV datasets in your project directory.

5. **Run the Streamlit Dashboard:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The dashboard will open in your default web browser.

## 💡 Usage

- **Navigate Tabs:** Explore Campaign Performance, Influencer Insights, Payout Tracking, Raw Data.
- **Apply Filters:** Use sidebar to filter by date, product, category, platform, minimum events.
- **Reset Filters:** "Reset All Filters" returns to default view.
- **Explore Data:** Interact with charts and data tables; export as CSV as needed.

## ⚠️ Important: Using `.gitignore` to Exclude Virtual Environments

When using Git for version control, **never commit your virtual environment folder (`venv/`)** or other system/generated files. This can make your repository huge, slow and lead to errors for collaborators.

**Why?**
- The `venv` folder contains many local, machine-specific files that are not needed to share your code.
- It will drastically increase your repository size and slow down git operations.
- It's best practice to regenerate environments locally via `requirements.txt`.

**How to Fix:**

1. **Stop any stuck git add processes** (press Ctrl+C).
2. **[Optional] Start fresh:**  
   If your repo is in a bad state, you can run `rmdir /s /q .git` (Windows) or `rm -rf .git` (macOS/Linux) in your project directory to remove the local git setup.
3. **Create a `.gitignore` file** in your project folder with the following contents:

   ```
   # Python virtual environment
   venv/
   *.pyc
   __pycache__/
   .ipynb_checkpoints/
   .env
   .DS_Store # macOS specific
   *.csv # If you generate CSVs and don't want to track them
   ```

   - `venv/` ensures your virtual environment is ignored.
   - `*.pyc`, `__pycache__/` ignore compiled Python files.
   - `.ipynb_checkpoints/` for Jupyter notebook checkpoint files.
   - `.env` for secrets/environment variables.
   - `.DS_Store` for macOS system files.
   - `*.csv` skips generated data files (uncomment if you don't want to track them).

4. **Initialize Git and add files:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git status  # Confirm venv/ is listed as "ignored" files
   git commit -m "Initial commit with .gitignore"
   ```

5. **Connect and push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <YOUR_REPO_URL>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

**Result:**  
Your repository stays clean, fast, and only contains code and assets that matter.

**For more information:**  
See the official [GitHub .gitignore documentation](https://github.com/github/gitignore).
